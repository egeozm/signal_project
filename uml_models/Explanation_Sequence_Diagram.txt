The state diagram for the Alert Generation System shows how an alert progresses from when it's first generated to when it's resolved. The diagram includes four main states: "Generated," "Sent," "Acknowledged," and "Resolved." These states are crucial for understanding how alerts are processed in a healthcare setting to ensure quick and efficient responses.

1.Generated: This state starts when patient data hits certain critical levels, triggering the alert system to react immediately.

2.Sent: The alert is sent to medical staff's devices to ensure they are informed quickly.

3.Acknowledged: Medical staff acknowledge receiving the alert, which helps prevent 
repeated notifications.

4.Resolved: The alert can be resolved automatically if the patient's condition improves, or manually if a staff member updates the system after treating the patient.

The sequence diagram outlines the interactions from when the alert is triggered by patient data until medical staff acknowledge it. Key steps include:

Data Checks: The AlertGenerator checks if patient data meets the alert criteria.

Historical Data Review: DataStorage is queried to confirm the data trend.

Alert Handling: An alert is created and sent, then acknowledged by the medical staff.
