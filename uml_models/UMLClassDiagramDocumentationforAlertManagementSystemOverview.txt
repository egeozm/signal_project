This UML class diagram represents the structure and interactions of classes within an alert management system designed to monitor patient data and generate alerts based on specific health conditions.

Classes and Interfaces

Alert

Description: Represents an alert that is triggered when certain conditions are met 
regarding a patient's health.

Attributes:

patientId: A unique identifier for the patient.
condition: Describes the health condition that triggered the alert.
timestamp: The time when the alert was generated.
label: Additional information or categorisation of the alert.

Methods:
Constructors, getters, and setters are typical for managing alert properties.

AlertGenerator

Description: Responsible for evaluating patient data and generating alerts when 
predefined conditions are detected.

Attributes:

dataStorage: Dependency on a data storage class that provides access to patient data.

Methods:

evaluateData(Patient patient): Processes patient data to determine if an alert should be triggered.
triggerAlert(Alert alert): Activates an alert, possibly involving logging or notification mechanisms.

AlertStorage

Description: Manages storage and retrieval of alert objects, ensuring that alerts are 
appropriately logged and can be accessed when required.

Attributes:

alerts: A collection that holds all generated alerts.
alertStorageStrategy: Strategy used for storing alerts, which can be changed dynamically.

Methods:

alertStore(Alert alert): Stores an alert using the specified storage strategy.
getAlerts(): Retrieves all stored alerts.

AlertStorageStrategy

Description: Interface that defines a method for storing alerts.

Methods:

store(Alert alert): Abstract method to be implemented by different storage strategies.
ConsoleAlertStorageStrategy

Description: Concrete implementation of the AlertStorageStrategy that logs alerts to the console.

Methods:

store(Alert alert): Implements the storage by printing alert details to the console.

Relationships

AlertGenerator to Alert: Uses relationship, indicating that AlertGenerator creates and 
manages Alert objects.

AlertGenerator to AlertStorage: Uses relationship, AlertGenerator may interact with 
AlertStorage to store generated alerts.

AlertStorage to Alert: Uses relationship, as AlertStorage manages instances of Alert.

AlertStorage to AlertStorageStrategy: Uses relationship, with AlertStorage utilizing 
an implementation of AlertStorageStrategy for storing alerts.

ConsoleAlertStorageStrategy to AlertStorageStrategy: Implementation relationship, where ConsoleAlertStorageStrategy is a specific type of AlertStorageStrategy.

Multiplicity

Each AlertGenerator can generate multiple Alerts.

Each AlertStorage can contain multiple Alerts but uses one AlertStorageStrategy at a time.

The relationship between AlertGenerator and AlertStorage typically involves a single instance of AlertStorage due to its design as a singleton.

Conclusion

This UML class diagram effectively captures the key components and interactions within the alert management system, providing a clear architectural overview. It serves as a useful tool for understanding the system's design and for guiding future developments or maintenance efforts.
