The Patient Identification System is crucial for ensuring accurate attribution of incoming patient data to existing records, a process vital for preventing medical errors and ensuring proper patient care. This system integrates seamlessly with hospital databases to match and verify patient information.

Key Components:

1.PatientIdentifier: This class is essential for identifying and matching incoming data with patient records in the database. It features methods such as:

matchPatientId(String patientId): Matches incoming data IDs with existing records.
getPatientRecord(String patientId): Retrieves detailed patient records.

2.PatientRecord: Represents detailed records of a patient, including personal information (name, date of birth) and medical history, which are crucial for accurate patient care management.

3.IdentityManager: Oversees the process of data matching, addressing any discrepancies to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

System Operation:

The system operates by continuously receiving and processing data from various sources, ensuring each piece of data is correctly linked to the corresponding patient 
profile through the PatientIdentifier.

It interfaces with the Data Storage system to update patient records and supports the Alert Generation system by providing necessary patient details for alerts.

This Patient Identification System highlights the importance of accurate data management in healthcare, ensuring patient safety and effective medical treatment.
