The Alert Generation System is designed to monitor patient data in real-time, generating alerts for critical medical conditions, ensuring prompt notification to medical staff.

Key Components:

1.AlertGenerator: Central to the system, it monitors incoming data from devices like heart rate monitors and blood pressure cuffs. It evaluates data against predefined criteria to identify potential emergencies.

2.Methods:
evaluateData(PatientData data): Analyses patient data.
triggerAlert(Alert alert): Triggers an alert if criteria are met.

3.Alert: Represents the alert itself, containing patient ID, the condition that triggered the alert, and a timestamp.
AlertManager: Manages the lifecycle of an alert from creation to delivery, ensuring alerts reach medical staff's devices efficiently.

Operation:

Each patient in the cardiovascular ward has a digital profile in the Comprehensive Health Monitoring System (CHMS) with specific alert thresholds. The AlertGenerator checks data against these thresholds, creating an Alert object managed by the AlertManager if criteria are met.
Communication:

The AlertGenerator retrieves necessary historical patient data from Data Storage and confirms patient identity through the Patient Identification system to ensure alerts are accurate and relevant.
