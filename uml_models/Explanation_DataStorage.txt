The Data Storage System is designed to effectively store and manage historical patient data, supporting both real-time monitoring and retrospective analysis in a healthcare setting.

Key Components:

1.DataStorage: This class is fundamental for storing patient data. It provides crucial functionalities such as:

storeData(PatientData data): Adds new patient data.
retrieveData(String patientId): Fetches historical data.
deleteData(String patientId): Removes obsolete data.

2.PatientData: Represents individual patient data at a specific time, including details like patient ID, health metrics (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), and a 
timestamp.

3.DataRetriever: Used by medical staff to access patient data securely, ensuring data privacy through rigorous security measures.

System Operation:

The system stores all patient data, from real-time vital signs to historical medical records, crucial for analysing health trends and supporting emergency interventions.
It operates on secure and encrypted channels to protect patient confidentiality.
Communication and Access:

The system provides an API for integration with the Alert Generation and Patient Identification systems, allowing specific data access for generating alerts and matching patient records accurately.
