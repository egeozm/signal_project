I only tested the classes and methods I created.

The only missing test in Alerts is ecg processECGRecords and I didn't test it because it's an iteration method for ECG
Alert Generator so if it is wrong ECG Test class also fails.

You can access all test reports via "target/site/jacoco/jacoco-sessions.html".
